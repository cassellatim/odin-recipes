        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>A Cobb salad is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with bacon, chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged in neat rows. It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins of the classic salad is unclear, but many believe it was created in the late 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood.</em></p>
